Conversely, some products with the highest conversion rates often receive the lowest page views.

For instance, the "DREAM TALKER - Native American Chief wall art" stands out as one of the products with the most views, but it conversion rates lag behind the median.
Conversely, products like "BURRO COUNTRY II - donkey art print" boast the highest conversion rate in the category but receive not so many page views.

<!-- Email marketing: Campaign ideas -->

In the following charts, a distinct variance in sales among different retailers is evident. Some retailers make substantially larger purchases than others. It's notable that the top 20% of retailers account for almost 80% of total sales over the course of the last 12 months. To be a retailer considered part of the top 20% it has to have made purchases over \$4000.

Conversely, it's apparent that a considerable amount of retailers tend to reorder within a short timeframe of less than 32 days.

Leveraging this data, we're poised to craft a targeted re-engagement initiative tailored towards retailers surpassing the \$4000 sales threshold, whose last purchase falls within the window of 35 to 70 days ago.

Furthermore, our analysis reveals that more than almost 68% of retailers who initiated their first purchase in 2023 failed to make a subsequent order. To address this, we propose a focused re-engagement campaign aimed at retailers who've made a singular purchase within the past 35 to 105 days.
