Upon closer inspection, a clear pattern emerges within the most frequented categories, revealing that certain products garner significant page views while their conversion rates fall below the category median.

In the following charts, a distinct variance in sales among different retailers is evident. Some retailers make substantially larger purchases than others. It's notable that the top 20% of retailers account for more than 60% of total sales over the course of the last 12 months. To be a retailer considered part of the top 20% it has to have made purchases over \$1200.

Conversely, it's apparent that a considerable amount of retailers tend to reorder within a long timeframe of almost 60 days.

Leveraging this data, we're poised to craft a targeted re-engagement initiative tailored towards retailers surpassing the \$1200 sales threshold, whose last purchase falls within the window of 60 to 120 days ago.

Additionally, your top 10 clients accounted for 6% of the revenue over the past 12 months. Reach out to them with personalized offers to encourage increased purchases.

Furthermore, our analysis reveals that more than 33% of retailers who initiated their first purchase in 2023 failed to make a subsequent order. To address this, we propose a focused re-engagement campaign aimed at retailers who've made a singular purchase within the past 60 to 120 days.
