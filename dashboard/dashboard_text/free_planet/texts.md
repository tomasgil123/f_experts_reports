<!-- Product optimization analysis -->

# 

__Product Titles:__ In our examination of product titles within t-shirt categories, we observed distinct strategies employed by different brands. Brands like Crazy Dog T-Shirt and OppoSuits - US often incorporate references to festivities or seasons (such as Saint Patrick's Day, Christmas, Halloween, etc.) into their titles. Conversely, Pycnic frequently utilizes the term "casual" and includes thematic elements related to the content of the t-shirt (such as food, coffee, cactus, etc.). Similarly, WEIV adopts a comparable approach to Pycnic, with frequent use of terms like flannel, sleeve, and checkered in their titles.

__Recommendation:__ Incorporate distinctive words into product titles to differentiate them from competitors. Try leveraging holiday-themed keywords in collection names, email campaign subjects, and content could serve as a strategic approach to boost seasonal sales.
