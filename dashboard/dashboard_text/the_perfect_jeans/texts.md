<!-- Product optimization analysis -->

# 

__Product Titles:__ While examining product titles in the "jeans" category, it's evident that most competitors employ similar wording. In addition, there is currently a lack of seasonal keywords in product titles and descriptions. Some brands (Victorious and Robink) mention the material of the jeans in the title (Denim).

__Recommendation:__ Incorporate distinctive words into product titles to differentiate them from competitors. Try leveraging holiday-themed keywords in collection names, email campaign subjects, and content could serve as a strategic approach to boost seasonal sales.
