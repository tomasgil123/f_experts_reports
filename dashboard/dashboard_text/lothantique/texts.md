This analysis delves deeply into each category, meticulously scrutinizing the performance of individual products alongside their respective page views.

Upon closer examination, it becomes evident that within the most viewed categories, a discernible trend emerges where a couple of products garner the majority of views, yet their conversion rates tend to fall below the category median. Conversely, products with the highest conversion rates often receive the lowest page views.

For instance, in the "Hand Soap" category, the "Laboratorio Olfattivo Biancofore Liquid Soap 500ml" is one of the products with the most views, but it conversion rate is the worst of the entire category. Conversely, products like "Christian Tortu Forests Liquid Soap 500ml" boast the highest conversion rate in the category but receive very low page views.

Similarly, in the "Hand and Body Lotions" category, the "Le Jardin d'Elisa 30ml Hand Cream" enjoys the most page views but exhibits the lowest conversion rate within its category.

__Opportunity:__ There is a clear opportunity to capitalize on products with high visibility but underperforming conversion rates. Consider implementing strategic updates to product presentation, such as refreshing imagery, integrating videos, or adjusting pricing. These experiments could provide valuable insights into enhancing conversion rates within these categories. Conversely, products with high conversion rates and low page views present an opportunity to increase visibility through SEO (updating title, description, tags, etc.).

<!-- Email marketing: Campaign ideas -->

In the following charts, a distinct variance in sales among different retailers is evident. Put simply, some retailers make substantially larger purchases than others. It's notable that the top 20% of retailers account for almost 60% of total sales over the course of the last 12 months. To be a retailer considered part of the top 20% it has to have made purchases over \$2100.

Conversely, it's apparent that a majority of retailers tend to reorder within a timeframe of 83 to 127 days after their last purchase.

Leveraging this data, we're poised to craft a targeted re-engagement initiative tailored towards retailers surpassing the \$2100 sales threshold, whose last purchase falls within the window of 3 to 9 months ago or occurred between 4 to 10 months ago.

Furthermore, our analysis reveals 65% of retailers who initiated their first purchase in 2023 failed to make a subsequent order. To address this, we propose a focused re-engagement campaign aimed at retailers who've made a singular purchase within the past 3 to 6 months.
