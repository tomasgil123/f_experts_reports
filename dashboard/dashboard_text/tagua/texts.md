<!-- Product: conversion by product -->

This analysis provides a thorough exploration of each category, meticulously examining the performance of individual products in tandem with their respective page views.

Upon closer inspection, a clear pattern emerges within the most frequented categories, revealing that certain products garner significant page views while their conversion rates fall below the category median. Conversely, products boasting the highest conversion rates often receive minimal page views.

For instance, within the "Dangle Earrings" category, products like "Fiesta Earrings" and "Amigas Earrings" attract substantial page views, yet their conversion rates trail behind the median. In contrast, products such as "Marianitas Earrings" demonstrate the highest conversion rates in the category but receive comparatively fewer page views.

__Opportunity:__ There is a clear opportunity to capitalize on products with high visibility but underperforming conversion rates. Consider implementing strategic updates to product presentation, such as refreshing imagery, integrating videos, or adjusting pricing. These experiments could provide valuable insights into enhancing conversion rates within these categories. Conversely, products with high conversion rates and low page views present an opportunity to increase visibility through SEO (updating title, description, tags, etc.).

<!-- Email marketing: Campaign ideas -->

In the ensuing analysis, discernible discrepancies in sales across various retailers become apparent. Put succinctly, certain retailers exhibit significantly higher purchase volumes compared to others. Notably, the top 20% of retailers contribute to more than 60% of the total sales over the last 12 months. To qualify as a retailer within this top percentile, purchases must exceed $1000. There is one single retailer that explains 12% of the total sales: Cottonways.

Nevertheless, despite these limitations, there is potential to devise targeted re-engagement strategies. A tailored initiative could be designed specifically for retailers surpassing the $1000 sales threshold, whose most recent purchase falls within the timeframe of 70 to 140 days ago.

Furthermore, our analysis uncovers that over 40% of retailers who made their inaugural purchase in 2023 did not proceed to place subsequent orders. To tackle this issue, we advocate for a focused re-engagement campaign targeting retailers who have made a single purchase within the past 30 to 90 days.
