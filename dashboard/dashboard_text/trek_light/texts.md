<!-- Product: conversion by product -->

# 

This analysis delves deeply into each category, meticulously scrutinizing the performance of individual products alongside their respective page views.

Upon closer examination, it becomes evident that within the most viewed categories, a discernible trend emerges where some products have high amount of page views compared to other products in the same category, yet their conversion rates tend to fall below the category median. Conversely, some products with the highest conversion rates often receive the lowest page views.

For instance, in the "Throw Blanket" category, the "Positive Vibrations Handwoven Throw Blanket" stands out as one of the products with the most views, but it conversion rates lag behind the median. Something similar happens with the "Belt Bags" category, where the "Everyday Funny Pack - Bloom" has the highest page views but a low conversion rate.
Conversely, products like "Everyday Funny Pack - Checkers" boast the highest conversion rate in the category but receive not so many page views.

__Opportunity:__ There is a clear opportunity to capitalize on products with high visibility but underperforming conversion rates. Consider implementing strategic updates to product presentation, such as refreshing imagery, integrating videos, or adjusting pricing. These experiments could provide valuable insights into enhancing conversion rates within these categories. Conversely, products with high conversion rates and low page views present an opportunity to increase visibility through SEO (updating title, description, tags, etc.).

<!-- Email marketing: Campaign ideas -->

In the following charts, a distinct variance in sales among different retailers is evident. Some retailers make substantially larger purchases than others. It's notable that the top 20% of retailers account for more than 60% of total sales over the course of the last 12 months. To be a retailer considered part of the top 20% it has to have made purchases over \$800.

Conversely, it's apparent that a considerable amount of retailers tend to reorder within a timeframe of less than 48 days.

Leveraging this data, we're poised to craft a targeted re-engagement initiative tailored towards retailers surpassing the \$800 sales threshold, whose last purchase falls within the window of 45 to 90 days ago.

Furthermore, our analysis reveals that more than almost 70% of retailers who initiated their first purchase in 2023 failed to make a subsequent order. To address this, we propose a re-engagement campaign aimed at retailers who've made a singular purchase within the past 45 to 90 days.
