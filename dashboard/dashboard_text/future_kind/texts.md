<!-- Email marketing: Campaign ideas -->

In the following charts, a distinct variance in sales among different retailers is evident. Some retailers make substantially larger purchases than others. It's notable that the top 20% of retailers account for more than 60% of total sales over the course of the last 12 months. To be a retailer considered part of the top 20% it has to have made purchases over \$900.

A considerable amount of retailers tend to reorder within a short timeframe of less than 37 days.

Leveraging this data, we're poised to craft a targeted re-engagement initiative tailored towards retailers surpassing the \$900 sales threshold, whose last purchase falls within the window of 45 to 90 days ago.

Furthermore, our analysis reveals that more than almost 57% of retailers who initiated their first purchase in 2023 failed to make a subsequent order. To address this, we propose a focused re-engagement campaign aimed at retailers who've made a singular purchase within the past 45 to 135 days.
