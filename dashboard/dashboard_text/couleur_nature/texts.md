Tablecloths, Tea Towels, Dinner and Cloth Napkins, and Table Runners stand out as the most popular categories, garnering the highest number of page views.

__Opportunity:__ There's a significant opportunity to enhance the visibility of categories with low page views yet high conversion rates through targeted SEO strategies. For instance, categories like "Aprons" and "Placemats" may not attract as many views as the top categories, but they have a good conversion rate of over 12%.

__Opportunity Bis:__ While Tablecloths dominate in views, categories such as Tea Towels, Dinner and Cloth Napkins, and Table Runners, though not as frequently visited, exhibit remarkable conversion rates exceeding 20%. Investing in SEO for these categories could yield substantial returns.
