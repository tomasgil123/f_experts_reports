This analysis delves deeply into each category, meticulously scrutinizing the performance of individual products alongside their respective page views.

Upon closer examination, it becomes evident that within the most viewed categories, a discernible trend emerges where some products have high amount of page views compared to other products in the same category, yet their conversion rates tend to fall below the category median. Conversely, some products with the highest conversion rates often receive the lowest page views.

For instance, in the "Bath Bomb & Fizz" category, the "Donut Bath Bomb 36 CT Display" is one of the most viewed products, yet its conversion rates fall below the median. Conversely, products like the "Rainbow Airbrushed Donut Bath Bomb" achieve the highest conversion rates in the category but receive relatively few page views. Notably, its conversion rate exceeds 100% because the number of products purchased surpasses the number of page views.

Consider implementing strategic updates to product presentation, such as refreshing imagery, integrating videos, or adjusting pricing. These experiments could provide valuable insights into enhancing conversion rates within these categories. Conversely, products with high conversion rates and low page views present an opportunity to increase visibility through SEO (updating title, description, tags, etc.).

<!-- Email marketing: Campaign ideas -->

In the following charts, a distinct variance in sales among different retailers is evident. Some retailers make substantially larger purchases than others. It's notable that the top 20% of retailers account for almost 50% of total sales over the course of the last 12 months. To be a retailer considered part of the top 20% it has to have made purchases over \$500.

Conversely, it's apparent that a considerable amount of retailers tend to reorder within a long timeframe of almost 90 days.

Leveraging this data, we're poised to craft a targeted re-engagement initiative tailored towards retailers surpassing the \$500 sales threshold, whose last purchase falls within the window of 90 to 270 days ago.

Furthermore, our analysis reveals that more than almost 62% of retailers who initiated their first purchase in 2023 failed to make a subsequent order. To address this, we propose a focused re-engagement campaign aimed at retailers who've made a singular purchase within the past 90 to 270 days.
