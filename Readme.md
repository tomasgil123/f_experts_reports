## Faire experts reports

### How do I create a faire experts report?

1. First, set as the default tab the tab you want to create a report from.
2. Run create-image.py file doing ```python create-image.py``` to create the images of the tab.
3. Then run create-pdf.py file doing ```python create-pdf.py``` to create the pdf report.



We are going to use the `stackedit` editor to write the reports. It is a web-based editor that allows us to write markdown files and export them to pdf. The editor is available at the following link:
