__Brand Minimums:__ Minimum order requirements show slight variation across brands, with Glimmer Wish and 42POPs not asking for a minimum order.

__Fulfillment time:__ Fulfillment times exhibit a substantial spectrum. The swiftest brands process orders within 1-3 days, while the slowest do between 6-10 days. Glimmer Wish falls within the 4-7 days range which is the most common.

<!-- Product: conversion by product -->

This analysis delves deeply into each category, meticulously scrutinizing the performance of individual products alongside their respective page views.

Upon closer examination, it becomes evident that within the most viewed categories, a discernible trend emerges where some products have high amount of page views compared to other products in the same category, yet their conversion rates tend to fall below the category median. Conversely, some products with the highest conversion rates often receive the lowest page views.

For instance, in the "Lugagge" category, the "Mermaid Travel Luggage Set" stands out as one of the products with the most views, but it conversion rates lag behind the median.
Conversely, products like "Mermaid Selfcare Keepal and Purple Pearl Pouch" boast the highest conversion rate in the category but receive not so many page views.

__Opportunity:__ There is a clear opportunity to capitalize on products with high visibility but underperforming conversion rates. Consider implementing strategic updates to product presentation, such as refreshing imagery, integrating videos, or adjusting pricing. These experiments could provide valuable insights into enhancing conversion rates within these categories. Conversely, products with high conversion rates and low page views present an opportunity to increase visibility through SEO (updating title, description, tags, etc.).

<!-- Email marketing: Campaign ideas -->

In the following charts, a distinct variance in sales among different retailers is evident. Some retailers make substantially larger purchases than others. It's notable that the top 20% of retailers account for almost 60% of total sales over the course of the last 12 months. To be a retailer considered part of the top 20% it has to have made purchases over \$400.

Conversely, it's apparent that a considerable amount of retailers tend to reorder within a short timeframe of less than 22 days.

Leveraging this data, we're poised to craft a targeted re-engagement initiative tailored towards retailers surpassing the \$400 sales threshold, whose last purchase falls within the window of 20 to 60 days ago.

Furthermore, our analysis reveals that more than almost 68% of retailers who initiated their first purchase in 2023 failed to make a subsequent order. To address this, we propose a focused re-engagement campaign aimed at retailers who've made a singular purchase within the past 20 to 60 days.

In the following charts, we delve deeper into the purchasing trends of various store types and their preferred products.

With this data we can create the following marketing campaigns:

- A campaign focused on "Clothing Boutiques" or "Spa or Beauty Store" that haven't bought brushes or mist products.

- A campaign focused on "Kids or Toy Store" that haven't bought "Mermaid Body Wash".
