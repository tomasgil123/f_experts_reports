<!-- Email marketing: Campaign ideas -->

In the following charts, a distinct variance in sales among different retailers is evident. Put simply, some retailers make substantially larger purchases than others. It's notable that the top 20% of retailers, accounting for almost 60% of total sales, spend more than \$1600 over the course of the last 12 months to qualify as top performers.

Conversely, it's apparent that a majority of retailers tend to reorder within a timeframe of 45 to 90 days after their last purchase.

Utilizing this data, we can devise a re-engagement campaign targeting retailers who have surpassed the $1600 sales mark but haven't placed an order in the past 45 to 90 days.

Also, we can see that 60% percent of retailers that made a purchase by the first time in 2023 didn't re-order. We can devise a re-engagement campaign targeting retailers that made only one order, but didn't make a second purchase in the past 45 to 90 days.
